## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cell phone survey}
setwd("C:\\Users\\prerak\\Desktop\\KSU\\Machine learning\\DataSets")
CellPhone <- read.csv('Cell Phone Survey.csv')
summary(CellPhone)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r CellPhone, echo=FALSE}
plot(CellPhone$Customer.Service)

```
```{r filter}
plot(x=CellPhone$Value.for.the.Dollar,
     y=CellPhone$Signal.strength,
     xlab='Value/Dollar',
     ylab='Signal.strength',
     xlim=c(1,5),
     ylim=c(1,5),
     main="S v/s D")
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r filter}
signal_filter <-filter(CellPhone, CellPhone$Signal.strength<2)
signal_filter
```
